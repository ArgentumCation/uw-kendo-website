        The Kendo Club at the University of Washington is a sports club
  		sponsored by the University of Washington Department of Recreational
  		Sports Programs. The Kendo Club at the UW is open to currently enrolled
  		UW students and faculty/staff members that have purchased a quarterly
  		or annual IMA Membership Card.<br><br>

        The Kendo Club at the University of Washington is a recognized
 		member dojo of the Pacific Northwest Kendo Federation and the All
 		United States Kendo Federation. Members of the club are eligible to
 		become members in good standing of both federations and are entitled
 		to all privileges of the same.<br><br>

        No martial arts experience is necessary to join the club. Kendo
  		is a martial art that can be practiced regardless of age, experience
  		or physical condition. If you are interested in joining the club,
 		we highly encourage you to come down and observe a practice to see
 		if Kendo is for you. Consult the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> below for answers
 		to some common questions.<br><br>

		Jeffrey Marsten. Wednesday night practices include kata, basic drills,
		waza, and keiko. Friday night practices are led by sensei from the area
		on a rotating schedule and feature drills, waza, and keiko.<br><br>

      Guests are welcome to practice with the club. However, this quarter the
      club is practicing within the UW Intramural Activities building
      (<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ima/IMA.ima.html">IMA</a>) -- a
      facility open only to University of Washington students, faculty, and staff.
      Please <a href="mailto:natejake@u.washington.edu">contact us</a> at least
      six hours before practice so that we can arrange guest admission.<br><br>

      	<b>I've never done kendo, can I join the club?</b>
		<p>Absolutely. The club has a very strong beginner program. No prior
		experience is necessary. The best time to join is the very first class
		of the quarter, usually the first Wednesday of the quarter. Please arrive
		at least five minutes early as we begin at 7pm sharp. The class progresses
		very quickly and all the early basic instruction is necessary to be
		successful. We will accept new members during the first two weeks
		of the quarter. After that, no new beginners will be accepted.</p>

        <b>I've done kendo before, can I join the club?</b>
        <p>Anyone with previous kendo experience is welcome to join the club
        anytime during the quarter. It is assumed that you know all the basics
        of kendo and will fit in with existing class groups.</p>

      	<b>Do I have to be in good shape?</b>
        <p>No. While it certainly does help to be in good physical shape,
  		it certainly isn't necessary. The act of training conditions the body
  		to do the art.</p>

        <b>Does it hurt?</b>
        <p>A little. The most common injuries for beginners is a blistered
   		left foot. This injury becomes less and less common as footwork
   		improves.<br><br>
        The most common injury that intermediate practitioners suffer is a
        bruised right wrist or hand. In general, the chance of suffering
        injury as a result of diligently practicing proper kendo is very low.</p>

        <b>Does the club participate in tournaments?</b>
		<p>Yes. The club participates in several regional tournaments throughout
		the year. These range from local tournaments, such as the Pacific
		Northwest Kendo Federation Annual Taikai in November to tournaments in
		Canada such as the Steveston Taikai in February. The club also hosts
		the University of Washington Invitational Kendo Taikai every April.</p>

        <b>Does the club sell all of the necessary equipment?</b>
        <p>Yes. We sell shinai, bokken, and uniforms. It is also possible to get
        armor through the club, though we loan out sets to use. If you wish to
        purchase armor or other kendo-related equipment, that can also be done
        through the club.</p>

        <b>How much does it all cost?</b>
        <p>Club dues are $10/quarter. PNKF membership dues are $20/year.
  		AUSKF membership dues are $36/year. Regional federation membership
  		entitles members to participate in tournaments, promotional exams, and
  		seminars. Membership in the PNKF also entitles members to take
  		advantage of the "open door" policy, which allows all PNKF members to
  		practice at other PNKF member dojos free of charge.<br><br>

        Compared to other martial arts, this is relatively cheap. The major
        cost is in equipment purchases. However, many of these purchases
        are one-time only. The first purchase a beginner is required to make
        is a bokken (solid wooden sword used for swinging/form  practice)
        which costs about $18. After a month or so, students must purchase a
        shinai (split bamboo sword used for striking) which costs anywhere
        from $20-$25. Sometime in the first two  quarters, it is recommended
        that students purchase uniforms. A complete set consisting of keikogi
		(light jacket) and hakama (pleated  trousers) starts at $100.<br><br>

        This may seem expensive at first, but keep in mind that these costs
        can be distributed over the period of two or three quarters. Easily
        the most expensive purchase in kendo is the bogu (armor). A decent
        set costs anywhere from $500-$1000. However, the club loans out sets
        to qualified members for free (free is good).<br><br>

        Keep in mind that much of this equipment will last for several years--
        making the overall expense far less than what many different arts charge
        in monthly dues alone. For a more indepth breakdown of costs, please
        refer to the <a href="kendo_costs.pdf">Kendo Cost Sheet</a>.</p>

        <b>I am not a current UW student, can I still practice at UW?</b>
        <p>Non-students/staff/faculty may not join the club as members,
        but members of the Pacific Northwest Kendo Federation may practice
        as guests. The Seattle area boasts a number of excellent dojos, if
        you are simply interested in learning Kendo and are not affiliated with
        UW then please see our links page to find out about other local dojos.</p>

        <b>Is Kendo like the Boffing Club?</b>
        <p>While both clubs may have enthusiastic practices, the similarities
        end there. Kendo may seem at first to be too restrictive on "swordplay"
        and movement, but the rewards come from dedication and patience through
        the practices over time. The discipline and mindset that evolves from
        kendo is representative of the points we emphasize--not spontaneous
        whacking with bamboo sticks. If there is one thing kendo isn't, it's
        instant gratification.</p>

        <b>I have more questions. Who can I contact?</b>
		<p>For questions/issues regarding the club or this site, send
		mail to: <a href="mailto:uwkc@u.washington.edu">uwkc@u.washington.edu</a>.
        For questions regarding kendo in general, please contact our club
      	president, <a href="mailto:natejake@u.washington.edu">Nate Jacobson</a>.</p>
