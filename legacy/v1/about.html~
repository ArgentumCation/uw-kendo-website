      If you are interested in joining the club, we highly encourage you to come 
      down and observe a practice to see if Kendo is for you. Consult the <A href = "#faq">FAQ</A>

      The Kendo Club at the University of Washington meets twice a week, on Wednesdays 
      and Fridays. The club does not meet/practice during academic breaks. Practices 
      on Wednesday nights are led by guest instructor Jeffrey Marsten. Wednesday 
      night practices include basic drills, waza, and keiko. After practice there 
      is an iaido clinic led by instructor Tom Bolling. Friday night practices 
      are lead by club advisor Dean Dejong and feature basic drills, waza, keiko, 
      and kendo kata(forms). <BR>

      In accordance with the Pacific Northwest Kendo Federation open-door policy, 
      guests are welcome to practice with the club free of charge. However, during 
      some quarters the club practices within the UW Intramural Activities building 
      (IMA)-- a facility open only to University of Washington students, faculty 
      and staff. In the event of this happening, please <A href = "mailto:uwkc@u.washington.edu">contact 
      us</A> to get on the pass list. This quarter, we are practicing in the Hec 
      Ed Pavillion Annex. This means visiting is no problem. Please come join 
      us for practice! <BR>

      </TABLE>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>I've never done kendo, can 
        I join the club?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Absolutely. The club has a very strong beginner program. No prior experience 
        is necessary. The best time to join is during the beginning of each quarter, however you are welcome to join at any time.<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Do I have to be in good shape?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        No. While it certainly does help to be in good physical shape, it certainly 
        isn't necessary. The act of training conditions the body to do the art.<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Does it hurt?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        A little. The most common injuries for beginners is a blistered left foot. 
        This injury becomes less and less common as footwork improves. <BR>
        <BR>
        The most common injury that intermediate practitioners suffer is a bruised 
        right wrist or hand. In general, the chance of suffering injury as a result 
        of diligently practicing proper kendo are very low.<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Does the club participate in tournaments?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Yes. The club participates in several regional tournaments throughout 
        the year. These range from local tournaments, such as the Pacific Northwest 
        Kendo Federation Annual Taikai in November to tournaments in Canada such 
        as the Steveston Taikai in February. The club also hosts the University 
        of Washington Invitational Kendo Taikai every April.<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>Does the club sell all of the necessary equipment?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Yes. We sell shinai, bokken, and uniforms. It is also possible to get 
        armor through the club, though we loan out sets to use. If you wish to 
        purchase armor or other kendo-related equipment, that can also be done 
        through the club.<BR>
        <BR>
        <B>How much does it all cost?</B><BR>
        <BR>
        Club dues are $10/quarter. PNKF membership dues are $20/year. AUSKF membership 
        dues are $36/year. Regional federation membership entitles members to 
        participate in tournaments, promotional exams and seminars. Membership 
        in the PNKF also entitles members to take advantage of the "open door" 
        policy, which allows all PNKF members to practice at other PNKF member 
        dojos free of charge.<BR>
        <BR>
        Compared to other martial arts, this is relatively cheap. The major cost 
        is in equipment purchases. However, many of these purchases are one-time 
        only. The first purchase a beginner is required to make is a bokken (solid 
        wooden sword used for swinging/form practice) which costs about $18. After 
        a month or so, students must purchase a shinai (split bamboo sword used 
        for striking) which costs anywhere from $20-$25. Sometime in the first 
        two quarters, it is recommended that students purchase uniforms. A complete 
        set consisting of keikogi (light jacket) and hakama (pleated trousers) 
        starts at $100. <BR>
        <BR>
        This may seem expensive at first, but keep in mind that these costs can 
        be distributed over the period of two or three quarters. Easily the most 
        expensive purchase in kendo is the bogu (armor). A decent set costs anywhere 
        from $500-$1000. However, the club loans out sets to qualified members 
        for free (free is good). <BR>
        <BR>
        Keep in mind that much of this equipment will last for several years-- 
        making the overall expense far less than what many different arts charge 
        in monthly dues alone.<BR>
        <br>
        <b>I am not a current UW student, can I still practice at UW?</b><br>
        <br>
        Non-students/staff/faculty may not join the club as members, but members 
        of the Pacific Northwest Kendo Federation may practice as guests. The 
        Seattle area boasts a number of excellent dojos, if you are simply interested 
        in learning Kendo and are not affiliated with UW then please see our links 
        page to find out about other local dojos.<br>
