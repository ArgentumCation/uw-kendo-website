<span class="subtitle">The Essential Points of the General Kendo Warm-ups</span><br />
1. Full but comfortable range of motion.<br />
2. Number of repetitions: 10 - 20<br />
3. Timing: Do movements with a smooth, continuous motion, no pauses.<br />
4. Relaxation: The more you relax during the exercises, the greater the benefits.<br />
5. Breathing: Breathe very deeply in time with the movements.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="subtitle">Tips for remembering the order</span><br />
Remember that the warm ups go in an order of:<br />
   Upper body<br />
   Lower body<br />
   Back<br />
With a set of bouncing in between every group of 3.  
The order of the warm ups are designed to get the 
blood moving from one region of your body to another, so if 
you forget the exact order you can always use another corresponding stretch.
