<p><a name="Q10">What is kendo?</a><br />
In two words, Kendo is Japanese Fencing. For a better in-depth definition than we could
possibly provide, please go <a href="http://www.kendo-usa.org/abtken.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Q1">I've never done kendo, can I join the club?</a><br />
Absolutely. The club has a very strong beginner program. No prior
experience is necessary. The best time to join is the very first class
of the quarter, usually the first Wednesday of the quarter. Please arrive
at least five minutes early as we begin at 7pm sharp. The class progresses
very quickly and all the early basic instruction is necessary to be
successful. We will accept new members during the first two weeks
of the quarter. After that, no new beginners will be accepted.</p>

<p><a name="Q2">I've done kendo before, can I join the club?</a><br />
Anyone with previous kendo experience is welcome to join the club
anytime during the quarter. It is assumed that you know all the basics
of kendo and will fit in with existing class groups.</p>

<p><a name="Q3">Do I have to be in good shape?</a><br />
No. While it certainly does help to be in good physical shape,
it certainly isn't necessary. The act of training conditions the body
to do the art.</p>

<p><a name="Q4">Does it hurt?</a><br />
A little. The most common injuries for beginners is a blistered
left foot. This injury becomes less and less common as footwork
improves.<br />
The most common injury that intermediate practitioners suffer is a
bruised right wrist or hand. In general, the chance of suffering
injury as a result of diligently practicing proper kendo is very low.</p>

<p><a name="Q5">Does the club participate in tournaments?</a><br />
Yes. The club participates in several regional tournaments throughout
the year. These range from local tournaments, such as the Pacific
Northwest Kendo Federation Annual Taikai in November to tournaments in
Canada such as the Steveston Taikai in February. The club also hosts
the University of Washington Invitational Kendo Taikai every April.</p>

<p><a name="Q6">Does the club sell all of the necessary equipment?</a><br />
Yes. We sell shinai, bokken, and uniforms. It is also possible to get
armor through the club, though we loan out sets to use. If you wish to
purchase armor or other kendo-related equipment, that can also be done
through the club.</p>

<p><a name="Q7">How much does it all cost?</a><br />
Club dues are $15/quarter. PNKF membership dues are $30/year.
AUSKF membership dues are $40/year. Regional federation membership
entitles members to participate in tournaments, promotional exams, and
seminars. Membership in the PNKF also entitles members to take
advantage of the "open door" policy, which allows all PNKF members to
practice at other PNKF member dojos free of charge.<br /><br />

Compared to other martial arts, this is relatively cheap. The major
cost is in equipment purchases. However, many of these purchases
are one-time only. The first purchase a beginner is required to make
is a bokken (solid wooden sword used for swinging/form  practice)
which costs about $18. After a month or so, students must purchase a
shinai (split bamboo sword used for striking) which costs anywhere
from $20-$25. Sometime in the first two  quarters, it is recommended
that students purchase uniforms. A complete set consisting of keikogi
(light jacket) and hakama (pleated  trousers) starts at $100.<br /><br />

This may seem expensive at first, but keep in mind that these costs
can be distributed over the period of two or three quarters. Easily
the most expensive purchase in kendo is the bogu (armor). A decent
set costs anywhere from $500-$1000. However, the club loans out sets
to qualified members for free (free is good).<br /><br />

Keep in mind that much of this equipment will last for several years--
making the overall expense far less than what many different arts charge
in monthly dues alone. For a more indepth breakdown of costs, please
refer to the <a href="files/kendo_costs_2006.pdf">Kendo Cost Sheet</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Q8">I am not a current UW student, can I still practice at UW?</a><br />
At this time, only students/staff/faculty may practice with the club. The Seattle
area boasts a number of excellent dojos, if you are simply interested in learning
Kendo and are not affiliated with UW then please see our links page to find out about
other local dojos.</p>

<p><a name="Q9">Is Kendo like the Boffing Club?</a><br />
While both clubs may have enthusiastic practices, the similarities
end there. Kendo may seem at first to be too restrictive on "swordplay"
and movement, but the rewards come from dedication and patience through
the practices over time. The discipline and mindset that evolves from
kendo is representative of the points we emphasize--not spontaneous
whacking with bamboo sticks. If there is one thing kendo isn't, it's
instant gratification.</p>

general, please contact our club president, Kyoka Himami: <img src="Emails/kyoka.gif" />.</p>
