The classic kendo body posture is taught for technical reasons basic to the art. Kenshi are urged to bear in mind the important health and safety benefits that result from keeping this posture. br /eathing is deep-, blood circulates freely, all the muscles are relaxed and poised, and the eyes are able to take in all surroundings easily. Constantly remaining in this classic stance makes it easy to accurately hit the desired target and minimizes or eliminates entirely "wild shots&quot which sting or br /uise one"s partner in inappropriate places. It also prevents twisting straining, or pulling one"s body painfully. Most injuries are immediate feedback letting you know that you are not doing what you were taught. The same may be said of ordinary everyday life. All kendo is based on the hypothesis that there is a "Force&quot (ki) which every individual can learn to tap. Without the proper posture, the "Force&quot can never flow freely or be fully available.',i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),'15. In particular, the special foot positions and footwork movements have very serious health and safety ramifications and must be learned thoroughly as the very first stage of kendo training. It is extremely important that both feet be pointed straight ahead at all times. The untrained tendency to turn or twist the left foot out must be altered consciously, as serious damage to the Achilles tendon may result from this action due to the heavy pressure advanced kendo movements br /ing to bear upon the left tendon. The orthodox kendo footwork also prevents blisters cracks, tears, and other minor foot injuries. The toes must slide or skim across the floor in the manner prescribed. This allows the kenshi to "feel&quot the terrain while keeping eye contact with the partner. It also keeps the toes from snagging on the skirt of the hakama, which may result in falling down, pulling a leg muscle, br /eaking toes, ankles, or other bones, etc. In other words, correct posture and correct footwork are absolutely essential to the safe as well as beautiful performance of kendo. Kendo can never be mastered without them, and it is dangerous to depart from them.',i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"16. Consistent attendance is essential to development in kendo. It also an important factor in safety. Absenteeism without adequate reason cannot be tolerated. Prolonged absence can only jeopardize the thinking other kenshi thus causing a weak dojo both physically and spiritually. You must notify the instructor or assistant instructor prior to any absences.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"17. All kenshi must take part in the regular warmup and stretching routine which begins every class or event. Late comers are required to bow in properly and go through the warmup routine on their own before they join the group practice. These warmups follow a careful plan and are not optional.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"18. When kenshi visit other clubs or attend tournaments they assume full responsibility for warming up and stretching properly, using the routine learned at our practice if necessary.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"19. The shinai (bamboo sword) must be carefully and thoroughly maintained by the kenshi on a continuous basis, and every shinai must be inspected for cracks, splinters, tom or br /oken leather fittings, or other damage, at the beginning of practice. Only perfect shinai may be used actual practice.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"20. During practice all kenshi must be vigilant about any damage which may occur to the shinai. Stop immediately to repair or replace any substandard shinai.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),'21. During practice all kenshi must alertly listen for the command "YAME&quot (stop), and instantly stop whatever they"re doing and look at instructor as soon as they hear it.',i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"22. For intermediate and advanced kenshi the correct wearing of bogu is required.

The design of the men (face guard) provides excellent protection for the eyes, but it is still possible for particles or splinters to enter the grillwork. Therefore kenshi are encouraged to consider the option of obtaining shatterproof plastic eyeglasses or a special plastic shield which snaps inside the grill for added defense of the eyes.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"24. During practice every kenshi must try hard not to injure fellow kenshi in any way, and must stop immediately if injury does occur. Abusive kendo is prohibited.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),"25. Actions taken in anger are never permitted. However, because the symbolic combative mode of kendo, sometimes people accidentally become temporarily angry. We are willing to bear risking a remote possibility of anger, because this training helps us learn to remain cool in real life situations. However, the concept is to learn never to lose control. Thus anger must be actively guarded against, and all kenshi must honestly stop if they become angry, or perceive that their partner is angry.",i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("b",null,"Summary"),i.a.createElement("br",null),"Proper kendo techniques will be carefully taught to every kenshi, but ultimate responsibility for safe and correct conduct of the art of kendo lies with the individual.
